Live word count (`live-wc')
==================================

Count text words (excluding code, properties, comments, ...) in real time.

Features
------------
- `live-wc-target' (local): Set word-count target for the buffer.
- `live-wc-fraction' (local): Display word count as
  absolute number of words (nil) or as fraction of target (t).
- Face color of mode-line display changes according to the fraction.
- Restrict word count to region if selected, optionally,
  show as fraction of total.
- Optionally, restrict word count to org-subtree using
  `live-wc-narrow-to-org-subtree'.
- Hover (mouse) over the segment for some more details.
- Mouse-click to set target/fraction.
- Bind keymap `live-wc-keymap' prefix to a suitable keybinding to access
  pre-bound commands that toggle/set buffer-local variables.

Minor mode
----------------
`live-wc-mode': Inserts =live-wc= segment in the mode-line.
`global-live-wc-mode': Inserts the segment in default mode-line.

Customization
-------------------
Customization group `live-wc' (`convenience', `display')
provides customization.

`live-wc-mode' is auto-enabled for each mode listed in `global-live-wc-modes'
(i.e. `text-mode' by default) and derivatives if the global mode is enabled.
