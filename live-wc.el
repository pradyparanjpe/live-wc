;; Live word count (`live-wc')
;; ==================================
;;
;; Count text words (excluding code, properties, comments, ...) in real time.
;;
;; Features
;; ------------
;; - `live-wc-target' (local): Set word-count target for the buffer.
;; - `live-wc-fraction' (local): Display word count as
;;   absolute number of words (nil) or as fraction of target (t).
;; - Face color of mode-line display changes according to the fraction.
;; - Restrict word count to region if selected, optionally,
;;   show as fraction of total.
;; - Optionally, restrict word count to org-subtree using
;;   `live-wc-narrow-to-org-subtree'.
;; - Hover (mouse) over the segment for some more details.
;; - Mouse-click to set target/fraction.
;; - Bind keymap `live-wc-keymap' prefix to a suitable keybinding to access
;;   pre-bound commands that toggle/set buffer-local variables.
;;
;; Minor mode
;; ----------------
;; `live-wc-mode': Inserts \\='live-wc\\=' segment in the mode-line.
;; `global-live-wc-mode': Inserts the segment in default mode-line.
;;
;; Customization
;; -------------------
;; Customization group `live-wc' (group `convenience' and group `display') provides
;; customization.
;;
;; `live-wc-mode' is auto-enabled for each mode listed in `global-live-wc-modes'
;; (i.e. `text-mode' by default) and derivatives if the global mode is enabled.
